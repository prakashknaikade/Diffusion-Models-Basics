This repo is a basic implementation of Diffusion Model to understand how diffusion works. This is the outcome of project course [How Diffusion Models Work](https://www.coursera.org/learn/how-diffusion-models-work-project/) that I completed. 

We will also explore more techniques related to Diffusion Models.
